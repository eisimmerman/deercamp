          A Camp is a private space shared by people who care about the same
          moments — family trips, seasons of life, shared experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no followers, no likes, and no algorithms shaping what
          matters.

          Camps are intentionally small, personal, and focused on memory —
          photos, voice, and context — not performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it as a digital place that feels more like a journal than a
          feed.
